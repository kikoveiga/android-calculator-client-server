# android-calculator-client-server
Simple Android app in Java that implements a Client-Server architecture by sending arithmetic calculation requests using Intents and Services.

## Run

To run this, you need to install both apps in your device. If it's a physical Android device, install the APKs. If you're on Android Studio, make sure to run the **app** or **MainAcitivty** of both apps in your AVD.
Next, make sure both apps are closed and run the Client App. The Client App will be able to "start" the Server App using a ***ForegroundService***.
